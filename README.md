Xilinx xfOpenCV Library
======================
The xfOpenCV library is a set of 50+ kernels, optimized for Xilinx FPGAs and SoCs, based on the OpenCV computer vision library. The kernels in the xfOpenCV library are optimized and supported in the Xilinx SDx Tool Suite.

## DESIGN FILE HIERARCHY
The library is organized into the following folders -

| Folder Name | Contents |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| examples | Examples that evaluate the xfOpenCV kernels, and demonstrate the kernels' use model in SDSoC flow |
| examples_sdaccel | Two examples that evaluate the xfOpenCV kernels, and demonstrate the kernels' use model in SDAccel flow. These 2 examples serve as reference on how to use all other supported xfOpenCV kernels in SDAccel |
| include | The relevant headers necessary to use the xfOpenCV kernels |

The organization of contents in each folder is described in the readmes of the respective folders.
For more information on the xfOpenCV libraries and their use models, please refer to the [Xilinx OpenCV User Guide][].

## HOW TO DOWNLOAD THE REPOSITORY
To get a local copy of the repository, clone this repository to the local system with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/xfopencv xfopencv
```
Where 'xfopencv' is the name of the directory where the repository will be stored on the local system.This command needs to be executed only once to retrieve the latest version of the xfOpenCV library. The only required software is a local installation of git.

## HARDWARE and SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
The xfOpenCV library is designed to work with Zynq and Zynq Ultrascale+ FPGAs. The library has been verified on zcu102 and zcu104 boards.
SDSoC 2018.3 Development Environment is required to work with the library.
zcu102 reVISION platform is required to run the library on zcu102 board and zcu104 reVISION platform to run on zcu104 board. Please download it from here: [reVISION Platform]

## Changelog:
1. Added new functions:

    • Demosaicing

    • Kalman Filter

2. Ported [HLS Video Library][] along with all supporting functions into xfOpenCV. For more details see "Migrating HLS Video Library to xfOpenCV" section of [UG1233][].

3. Added UltraRAM support for the following  functions:

      • Box Filter

      • Canny Edge Detection

      • Demosaicing

      • Dense Pyramidal Optical Flow

      • Harris Corner

      • Histogram Of Gradients (HOG)

      • Kalman Filter

      • Non-Pyramidal Optical Flow

      • Pyramid down

      • Remap

      • Sobel filter

      • StereoLBM

      • Stereo Pipeline

      • Warp Transform



4. A subset of xfOpenCV functions now support SDAccel flow. Added 2 examples as reference and a methodology chapter in [UG1233][].

5. Minor bug fixes.

#### Known Issues:
1. Windows OS has path length limitations, kernel names must be smaller than 25 characters.
2. Missing one command from the list of commands in Chapter 3 "Evaluating the Functionality" section of UG1233. Details [here](https://github.com/Xilinx/xfopencv/examples_sdaccel/UG1233_errata.md).
